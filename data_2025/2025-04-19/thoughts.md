How to combine the data from different operational conditions?
Two different fission rates, grain sizes, and fuel temperatures.

It's a good idea to analyze them individually first.

What about the problem statement for IUQ?
Should I average all the swelling results from different conditions?
The swelling correlation comes from the average of swelling results
from different operational conditions as well.
We need to make the problem statement rigorous.
