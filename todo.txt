GET YOUR MASTER'S

positive affirmations about your job
either work or don't do anything at all
make your subtasks as small as possible

TODO
- optimize surrogates
- global SA
  - Sobol' indices
- feature importance
- multiple MCMC chains
- convergence diagnostics
- swelling vs F_d using the param posteriors
  - use all the surrogates for that
  - compare against the target and the dataset
- start writing

BIG PICTURE
- prediction bounds are very wide
  - everything falls within the bounds
  - ANL is using sum of squared errors but no indication
	about how they did the Bayesian analysis
- Pareto frontier
- try to implement the scheme in Wu's paper roughly
  - doesn't need to have rigorous basis
- read more papers on IUQ
- read the DAKOTA theory section
- variance based SA makes use of surrogates
- posteriors from different analysis seem different
  - find the cause
- compare the initial parameter distributions to the posteriors

DONE
- clean the data structure
  - put all the F_d info in one column
- visualize the clean data
- fit a GP to the bias data
  - plot the uncertainty in the GP model too
- plot fs1 against fs2 to see if they are independent
- expectations have been manually modified; fix them
  - prediction bounds are closer to the observation noise
- make multivariate target output
  - try fs independence anyway
  - see what happens if you run MCMC
- use data at 1e21 (or 3e21) and 7e21 to perform IUQ
  - swelling at these F_ds are independent
- combine different types of output with mvn gaussian
- vary the low/med F_d data in the target
- use a multivariate gaussian for proposal distribution
