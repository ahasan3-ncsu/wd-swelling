GET YOUR MASTER'S

either work or don't do anything at all
FOR FUCK'S SAKE, BLOCK ALL DISTRACTIONS!
one itty-bitty subtask at a time

ISSUES
- remove some params from MCMC sampling
- should we have teleport in the MCMC? No.
  - zero prior rejects the sample automatically
  - how to implement that in the sampler?
	- handle 0/0 when computing the acceptance ratio
	- reject these cases
	- might get stuck in the corner
	- we might get uniform distributions
- how to deal with multiple irradiation conditions?

FIGURES/TABLES
DEF
- Parameters and their ranges
- Data exploration
  - Correlation heatmap
  - Scatterplot against fuel swelling
  - Sobol' indices?
- Target distribution
RES
- Surrogates
  - Why LASSO should be used?
  - Prediction vs actual graphs
  - Table with R2/RMSE/MAE
- MCMC samples (show 2 chains)
  - Histograms too (with 2 chains)
	- Convergance diagnostic
  - Show fitted distributions with the histograms
    - Goodness of fit
- Forward propagation from both the samples and
  the fitted distribtions
  - Measure the similarity of two distributions

FLOW
- problem definition
- target distribution
- exploration of data
  - model vs exp. data as a function of F_d
  - correlation heatmap
  - Sobol' indices
- choosing two F_d for analysis
- dimensionality reduction
  - try something other than PCA
- surrogate modeling
  - at least 2
- MCMC iteration
  - redo the iterations maybe?
  - convergence diagnostics
- FUQ with surrogates
  - cross validation with multiple surrogates?
	- doesn't seem to work!
  - did we achieve the target? graphs!
- param prior vs posterior
  - posterior cannot be outside the prior

BIG PICTURE
- prediction bounds are very wide
  - everything falls within the bounds
  - ANL is using sum of squared errors but no indication
	about how they did the Bayesian analysis
- Pareto frontier
- try to implement the scheme in Wu's paper roughly
  - doesn't need to have rigorous basis
- read more papers on IUQ
- read the DAKOTA theory section
- variance based SA makes use of surrogates
- posteriors from different analysis seem different
  - find the cause
- compare the initial parameter distributions to the posteriors
- PCA doesn't work because the param values are orthogonal by design
