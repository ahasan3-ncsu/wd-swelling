either work or don't do anything at all
FOR FUCK'S SAKE, BLOCK ALL DISTRACTIONS!
one itty-bitty subtask at a time

FLOW
- problem definition
- target distribution
- exploration of data
  - model vs exp. data as a function of F_d
  - correlation heatmap
  - Sobol' indices
- choosing two F_d for analysis
- dimensionality reduction
  - try something other than PCA
- surrogate modeling
  - at least 2
- MCMC iteration
  - redo the iterations maybe?
  - convergence diagnostics
- FUQ with surrogates
  - copulas
  - cross validation with multiple surrogates?
	- doesn't seem to work!
  - did we achieve the target? graphs!
  - measure the similarity of two distributions
	- goodness of fit
- param prior vs posterior
  - posterior cannot be outside the prior

BIG PICTURE
- prediction bounds are very wide
  - everything falls within the bounds
  - ANL is using sum of squared errors but no indication
	about how they did the Bayesian analysis
- Pareto frontier
- try to implement the scheme in Wu's paper roughly
  - doesn't need to have rigorous basis
- read more papers on IUQ
- read the DAKOTA theory section
- variance based SA makes use of surrogates
- posteriors from different analysis seem different
  - find the cause
- compare the initial parameter distributions to the posteriors
- PCA doesn't work because the param values are orthogonal by design
- how to deal with multiple irradiation conditions?
