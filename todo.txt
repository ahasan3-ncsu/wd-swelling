GET YOUR MASTER'S

positive affirmations about your job
either work or don't do anything at all
make your subtasks as small as possible

TODO
- make multivariate target output
  - try fs independence anyway
  - see what happens if you run MCMC
- use data at 1e21 (or 3e21) and 7e21 to perform IUQ
  - swelling at these F_ds are independent
- try to implement the scheme in Wu's paper roughly
  - doesn't need to have rigorous basis
- read more papers on IUQ

PROMISED
- use orig. robinson correlation pred bounds
- combine multi output into a single output
- how to combine different types of output
  - look at DAKOTA manual
- writeup

BIG PICTURE
- do we need the uncertainty in the GP model?
  - is it ok to use lasso?
- bias estimation across all F_d
  - dart underestimates swelling (+ve bias)
- prediction bounds are very wide
  - everything falls within the bounds
  - ANL is using sum of squared errors but no indication
	about how they did the Bayesian analysis
- compare the initial parameter distributions used to make
  the dataset to the final MCMC distributions
- using bias in IUQ might make things worse

DONE
- clean the data structure
  - put all the F_d info in one column
- visualize the clean data
- fit a GP to the bias data
  - plot the uncertainty in the GP model too
- plot fs1 against fs2 to see if they are independent
- expectations have been manually modified; fix them
  - prediction bounds are closer to the observation noise
