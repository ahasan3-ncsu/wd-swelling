GET YOUR MASTER'S

either work or don't do anything at all
FOR FUCK'S SAKE, BLOCK ALL DISTRACTIONS!
one itty-bitty subtask at a time

ISSUES
- should we have teleport in the MCMC? No.
  - zero prior rejects the sample automatically
  - how to implement that in the sampler?
	- handle 0/0 when computing the acceptance ratio
	- reject these cases
	- might get stuck in the corner
	- we might get uniform distributions
- how to deal with multiple irradiation conditions?

FLOW
- problem definition
- target distribution
- exploration of data
  - model vs exp. data as a function of F_d
  - correlation heatmap
  - Sobol' indices
- choosing two F_d for analysis
- dimensionality reduction
  - try something other than PCA
- surrogate modeling
  - at least 2
- MCMC iteration
  - redo the iterations maybe?
- FUQ with surrogates
  - criss cross validation
  - did we achieve the target? graphs!
- param prior vs posterior
  - posterior cannot be outside the prior

TODO
- start writing
  - define the outline
  - fill with contents
- read Ziyu's papers thoroughly
  - follow the procedure in your work
- use functional PCA for dim reduction
- optimize surrogates
  - maybe use bayesian NNs
  - validate your surrogates
- multiple MCMC chains
  - easy to implement
  - just call the func. multiple times
- convergence diagnostics
- swelling vs F_d using the param posteriors
  - use all the surrogates for that
  - compare against the target and the dataset
- come up with cool figures

BIG PICTURE
- prediction bounds are very wide
  - everything falls within the bounds
  - ANL is using sum of squared errors but no indication
	about how they did the Bayesian analysis
- Pareto frontier
- try to implement the scheme in Wu's paper roughly
  - doesn't need to have rigorous basis
- read more papers on IUQ
- read the DAKOTA theory section
- variance based SA makes use of surrogates
- posteriors from different analysis seem different
  - find the cause
- compare the initial parameter distributions to the posteriors
- PCA doesn't work because the param values are orthogonal by design

DONE
- clean the data structure
  - put all the F_d info in one column
- visualize the clean data
- fit a GP to the bias data
  - plot the uncertainty in the GP model too
- plot fs1 against fs2 to see if they are independent
- expectations have been manually modified; fix them
  - prediction bounds are closer to the observation noise
- make multivariate target output
  - try fs independence anyway
  - see what happens if you run MCMC
- use data at 1e21 (or 3e21) and 7e21 to perform IUQ
  - swelling at these F_ds are independent
- combine different types of output with mvn gaussian
- vary the low/med F_d data in the target
- use a multivariate gaussian for proposal distribution
- global SA using SALib
  - Sobol' indices
